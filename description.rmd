In the app a function calculates the percentage of data used for skype or surfing(input by the user).
And a prediction is made as to what kind of data plan the user should buy the next time.

i.e if the user consumes more data by using skype he should buy a data(internet) plan which has less jitter.
(i.e a high speed plan)
and if the user consumes more data by surfing than skype then he/she must by high total data plan.
So the app basically recomends what kind of internet plan the user must buy based on his data usage pattern
